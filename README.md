# Python-Calculator

[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

A simple python calculator made with tkinter. The code is clean and can be easily edited.

# Setup
This app requires python and tkinter to be installed on your computer. Python can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads)

In order to install tkinter in your computer, open command prompt/terminal and type the following command

```sh
pip install tk
```

The app's gui is currently a bit wonky and i do plan to fix it in the very near future

# Thanks for downloading :)
